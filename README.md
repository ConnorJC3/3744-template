# EEL3744C LaTeX Lab Report Template

## What is it?

This is a LaTeX template for labs in the 2020 fall semester of EEL3744C, for those of us who love LaTeX like me. It replicates the word-based template with an extremely high level of accuracy, but allows for creating your lab reports in LaTeX.

## How do I use it?

Download `3744lab.cls`, place it next to your `.tex` file, and use `\documentclass{3744lab}`.  
See [demo.tex](demo.tex) for example source code, and [demo.pdf](demo.pdf) for the output of that example.
